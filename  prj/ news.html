       <h3>Following the terror attacks on Indian military bases at Pathankot and later Uri in 2016, one of the deadliest attacks on the forces after more than a decade-long lull in Jammu and Kashmir, New Delhi embarked on the policy of isolating Pakistan from all international fora, beginning with cancellation of the 19th SAARC summit due in Islamabad later that year. Armed with sufficient evidence of the Pakistani involvement in these attacks, New Delhi was convinced this would be sufficient for the world to acknowledge Pakistan’s role in destabilising the region and make a case for international pressure on it. The belief was further bolstered with Donald Trump’s victory in November 2016, whose avowed criticism of Pakistan had even got it initially unnerved.</h3> <br> <br>

      <h3>Gauri Lankesh Murder: With 15 Bullets, Did Ammunition Supplier Have Others on Hit List?
For someone to access 15 of the 0.32 revolver bullets could not have been easy. Call data records have revealed that the calls Naveen Kumar has been receiving recently are from public booths. This indeed has led to greater suspicions on who he was dealing with.
Bengaluru: Four days after 37-year-old KT Naveen Kumar was taken into custody by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) in connection with journalist Gauri Lankesh’s murder, two larger questions still loom – What was he doing with 15 cartridges and how did he get access to it?

       <h3>Making a comeback in the Indian Premier League after a gap of two years, Chennai Super Kings were dealt a big blow ahead of the 11th edition as New Zealand spinner Mitchell Santner was ruled out of the tournament due to a knee injury. Santner, who was bought for Rs 50 lakh at IPL 2018 auctions, was a key player for the Yellow Brigade considering the two-time champions will already be without the services of R Ashwin, who has been appointed as the new skipper of Kings XI Punjab.
